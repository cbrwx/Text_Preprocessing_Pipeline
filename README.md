## Text Preprocessing Pipeline

This code provides a text preprocessing pipeline for preparing text data for various NLP models. The code includes several functions that perform the following tasks:

- Removing email addresses
- Removing unwanted characters
- Expanding contractions (e.g., "don't" to "do not")
- Converting all text to lowercase
- Replacing numbers with a special token
- Replacing multiple spaces with a single space
- Removing leading and trailing spaces from each line
- Removing empty lines
- Tokenizing the text
- Lemmatizing the tokens
- Saving the lemmatized text to a new file
- The preprocessing pipeline uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which provides tools for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

To use the pipeline, simply specify the input file and the output file. The input file should contain the raw text data, and the output file will contain the preprocessed text.

This code is useful for preparing text data for a variety of NLP models, including GPT-2 and LSTM models. By applying the preprocessing pipeline, the text data is cleaned and standardized, which can improve the performance of the models.

To run this code, ensure that the required packages are installed (NLTK), download the punkt and wordnet resources from NLTK, and modify the input and output file paths as necessary. This code can be easily adapted to handle other preprocessing tasks or to customize the pipeline for specific use cases.
